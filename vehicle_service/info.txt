Advantages:

Simplicity: This approach is cleaner, easier to read, and avoids boilerplate code.
Type Safety: You no longer need to cast the Principal object to Jwt, which makes the code safer.
2 - SecurityContextHolder for Advanced Use Cases: 
If you need more control (e.g., accessing authorities or using other authentication methods), 
accessing the SecurityContextHolder manually, 
as you are doing, is perfectly fine. However, 
the @AuthenticationPrincipal approach should be preferred 
for typical use cases where you're
only interested in the user's authentication details.
